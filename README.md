## Specific topics in this section

In this section, we'll design the YesNo app, which will eventually answer our questions (as long as they're yes or no), we'll cover:

 - TextEditingControllers
 - FocusNodes
 - ThemeData
 - Widgets such as:

This section is full of content to build this small chat, by the end of this section, we'll have a good foundation for how to host state outside of widgets and how widgets can update and retrieve the information they need from the state manager.
